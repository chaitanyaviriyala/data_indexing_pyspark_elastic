# Large Scale Data indexing Pyspark & Elastic

The goal of this project is to leverage PySpark for processing and preparing large datasets and then efficiently indexing the processed data into Elasticsearch. This creates a searchable index for analytics, reporting, and fast retrieval of information.

This repo hosts the link to all the code.
